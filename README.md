# Riverstone Agent

## Overview

This project implements a voice-enabled AI sales agent for Riverstone Place, a fictional Melbourne apartment development.

The agent qualifies buyers, answers FAQs, handles objections, and books appointments.

It uses the following stack:
- FastAPI for backend API (voice_agent.py)
- Streamlit for frontend UI (app.py)
- Google Gemini for conversational AI (LLM)
- ElevenLabs (primary) and gTTS (fallback) for text-to-speech (voice responses)
- SQLite for lead logging and compliance tracking
- A live demo is available here:

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MAvRK7/riverstone-agent.git
   cd riverstone-agent

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   

4. Create a .env file with the following content:

   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
   ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=your_voice_id
   BACKEND_URL=https://your-deployed-backend-url/call
   BACKEND_API_KEY=optional_backend_api_key

5. Run the application:
   
   ```bash
   python voice_agent.py

6. Run the Streamlit frontend:

   ```bash
   python -m streamlit run "app.py"

## Limitations (Free Demo)

- Phone number / calling not implemented ‚Äì Twilio/Retell require paid numbers.
- Backend hosting on Render free tier ‚Äì server idles after ~15 minutes.
- Text-to-Speech ‚Äì ElevenLabs works locally, but free cloud hosting doesn‚Äôt reliably support audio playback.

## Cost & Next Steps

Cost to run ~100 calls: ~$30‚Äì50/month (Twilio for calls + persistent hosting + TTS API usage).
If extended, improvements could include:
- Persistent hosting (Render paid / AWS / GCP).
- Fully integrated TTS in the cloud.
- Phone-call support via Twilio or Retell.
- Richer UI/UX with conversation history.
- Integration with Calendly or Google Calendar for real bookings.
